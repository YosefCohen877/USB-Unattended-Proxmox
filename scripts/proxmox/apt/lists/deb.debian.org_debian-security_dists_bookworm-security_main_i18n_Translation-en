 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").

 Original USB device drivers and applications can be used for remote USB
 devices without any modification of them.  A computer can use remote USB
 devices as if they were directly attached.
 .
 Currently USB/IP provides no access control or encryption.  It should only
 be used in trusted environments.

 should normally not use @babel/standalone. Instead, you should use a build
 system running on Node.js, such as Webpack, Rollup, or Parcel, to transpile
 your JS ahead of time.
 .
 However, there are some valid use cases for @babel/standalone:
  * It provides an easy, convenient way to prototype with Babel. Using
    @babel/standalone, you can get started using Babel with just a simple
    script tag in your HTML.
  * Sites that compile user-provided JavaScript in real-time, like JSFiddle,
    JS Bin, the REPL on the Babel site, JSitor, etc.
  * Apps that embed a JavaScript engine such as V8 directly, and want to use
    Babel for compilation
  * Apps that want to use JavaScript as a scripting language for extending the
    app itself, including all the goodies that ES2015 provides.
  * Other non-Node.js environments (ReactJS.NET, ruby-babel-transpiler,
    php-babel-transpiler, etc).

 What makes Orthanc unique is the fact that it provides a RESTful
 API. Thanks to this major feature, it is possible to drive Orthanc
 from any computer language. The DICOM tags of the stored medical
 images can be downloaded in the JSON file format. Furthermore,
 standard PNG images can be generated on-the-fly from the DICOM
 instances by Orthanc.

Description-md5: 83dff66615250b53a0cd3df6fb3b9ea7
Description-en: clustered database to store temporary data
 CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other
 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for
 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Package: tor-geoipdb
Description-md5: d0b50c9cd91157b8c85856fd55e26d14
Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

Package: trafficserver

 This package provides the Apache Traffic Server, a fast, scalable reverse
 proxy server which may operate as forward proxy as well. Apache Traffic Server
 supports:
 .
   * Caching: improve response time while reducing server load and bandwidth
     needs by caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages, images, and
     web service calls.
   * Proxying: add keep-alive, filter or anonymize content requests, or add
     load balancing by adding a proxy layer.
   * Scaling: handle 10s of thousands of requests per second on modern SMP
     hardware.
   * Extensions: use the API to do anything from modifying HTTP headers to

 HTTP content it is still preferable to expose the content produced by the
 Tryton server via HTTPS with a dedicated web frontend like Nginx on top of
 a robust WSGI application. Nginx has decent default security settings, can
 talk to WSGI applications by the native WSGI protocol, and also offers
 features like caching of dynamic content, load balancing, and serving
 static resources.

 For small sites that are not exposed to the Internet this may already cover
 your needs; otherwise have a look at the package tryton-server-nginx to run
 the uWSGI server behind a dedicated reverse proxy.

Description-md5: 1cd5b85acd06c23d376b7b5a7f30a0b8
Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.
